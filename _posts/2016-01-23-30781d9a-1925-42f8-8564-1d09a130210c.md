HipHop was facebook's attempt to make php faster. They tried to convert source code parts to native machine code, which worked quite well. Now they work on another (but quite related) approach called hhvm (hiphop virtual machine), which is even nicer. I installed it on a ubuntu vm and it runs like a charm.
